          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            In todayâ€™s digital age, cryptocurrencies have revolutionized financial transactions, 
            offering speed, anonymity, and accessibility. However, these features have also given rise to challenges, 
            such as the misuse of cryptocurrencies for illicit activities, including transferring defrauded money. 
            Our mission is to bring transparency and accountability to cryptocurrency transactions 
            without compromising the core principles of privacy and decentralization.

            Our platform provides a secure mechanism for recording peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions, 
            enabling crypto exchanges to contribute data in a standardized, traceable manner. By bridging the gap 
            between on-chain transaction data and user-specific information provided by exchanges, we aim to address 
            critical challenges, including:

            <p>
              <strong>1. Data Collection:</strong> Crypto exchanges upload transaction data, including sender and 
              receiver details, transaction hashes, amounts, and timestamps, through a secure portal.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>2. Verification:</strong> The system validates the uploaded data with blockchain explorer APIs 
              to ensure integrity and accuracy.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>3. Traceability:</strong> Using advanced analytics, authorities can trace transaction paths and 
              identify suspicious patterns or wallet clustering.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>4. Privacy Assurance:</strong> Sensitive user data is encrypted and accessible only to authorized 
              entities, ensuring compliance with privacy laws.
